CS 4641 - Machine Learning - Assignment 4
Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning

In this project I used 1 library:
-BURLAP
A lot of the code was inspired by 
https://github.com/ckabuloglu/CS4641_HW4_MDPs_and_Reinforcement_Learning
I created unique problems as well creating new functions and edited existing ones.

1. In order to run my experiments you will need Java 8 and Eclipse IDE for Java developers installed.
	Eclipse: -https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer
2. Download this Folder (self explanatory) since it includes BURLAP and all the necessary code.
3. Import the project inside Eclipse by clicking in the top-level bar, File>Open Projects From File Systems, then navigate and import /BURLAP.
4. When the project is imported, right click on the top-level directory shown on the left.
5. Navigate through context menu to Maven, then click Update Project. This should resolve classpath issues.
Note: if you're having issues related to the classpath, or import/dependency issues try to repeat steps 4 and 
6. While inside the directory structure \BURLAP\src\main\java\MyProject right-click on the HardGridWorldLauncher or BasicaGridWorldLauncher.
7. Go to the “Run As…” section and select “Java Application". the Project: should be BURLAP.
8. All three algorithms will run and the aggregate analysis and optimal policies will be printed to the console.
The main class should be MyProject.HardGridWorldLauncher or MyProject.BasicGridWorldLauncher

All the figures for the Hard GridWorld Were stored in "Result_" folders.
All the code should be in \BURLAP\src\main\java\MyProject

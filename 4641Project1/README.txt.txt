In order to run the code, you will need Python 2.7 and the following libraries:
matplotlib
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
scikit-plot
time

The Files are arranged such that all you need to do is run each python file that begins with "Breast_" or "Space_"
with an appropriate abbreviation of the learning algorithm. The files will output graphs and metrics pertaining to training performance.
ANN - Artificial Neural Network
Boosting - Decision Tree with AdaBoost
DT - Decision Trees
KNN - K Nearest Neighbor
SVM - Support Vector Machine.

the getBreast and getSpace files do not need to be run, they were there to generate the necessary dataSets.
The data is stored in the BreastData and SpaceData files. The files are prepartitioned.

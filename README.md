# Machine_Learning_GT_CS4641
Software Written for CS 4641 Fall 2018 at Georgia Tech.
Each Folder is a project for the class containing a report, the source code, and a readme.txt file describing the tech stack.

Project 1: Supervised Learning and experimenting with different techniques such as Neural Networks and SVM's

Project 2: Random Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and a Genetic Algorithm as a means of Neural Network Backprop.

Project 3: Unsupervised Learning, explored techniques like PCA and Clustering techniques like K-means and GMM's

Project 4: Reinforcement Learning, solving Markov Decision Processes with Q-learning, Value Iteration, and Policy Iteration
